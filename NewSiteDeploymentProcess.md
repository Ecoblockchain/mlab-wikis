# Process to deploy a new M-Lab web site #

This page provides an high level description of the steps to deploy a new M-Lab sites.
Detailed instructions are provided before a deployment.

# Steps #

  * The M-Lab team and the potential host talk about the (fairly minimal) effort required to set things up and whether the host is willing to provide that effort.
  * The potential host reads the [technical requirements](http://www.measurementlab.net/download/AMIfv95m-KO8C1kQNb9itpS0rL-yPRvKsQrHSCWMoQ4kJkrE98tm_JKhuLc-Su9xVC5EPMEVvFeGgHiScDq0VKIOj-JAj5HdnMtw0_q3affmPUF3qUcbPMqF1jXbE8Z5gdEELPcuLjeXO_XQ7y_b262qblA583G-iw/) for hosting an M-Lab site.
  * The potential host provides a verbal agreement to host an M-Lab site.
  * The potential host completes the [online form](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHNMZ2p0OU5TckxIUFg0RVNhSk5teEE6MQ#gid=0) to collect information about the potential site.
  * The M-Lab team reviews the answers to see if all hosting requirements are met. Otherwise, there could be some additional discussion to reach a shared understanding.
  * If all hosting requirements are met, the M-Lab team sends the host the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
  * The host signs the MOU and sends it back to the M-Lab team.
  * The equipment is ordered and shipped to the site location.
  * The M-Lab team registers the new site and provides boot images to the host.
  * The M-Lab team sends the installation documentation and coordinates the installation with the local staff provided by the host.
    * The full installation usually takes about 2-3 hours.
    * The installation is complete when the installation tests pass.
  * The M-Lab team integrates the new site in the M-Lab site management and monitoring system, then installs the M-Lab tools onto the new servers.
  * The new site is added to M-Labâ€™s loadbalancer and data collection pipeline.
  * **The site is up and running!**
  * The M-Lab team adds the name of the host to the [list of the M-Lab partners](http://www.measurementlab.net/who).
  * The M-Lab team monitors and maintains the installation remotely. If a fault cannot be addressed remotely, the M-Lab team will contact the host to request a reboot or a replacement.
